# TriSig 
Description: A method designed to evaluate the statistical significance of patterns in tensor data. To demonstrate the properties of *TriSig*, a industrial [penicillin batches dataset](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2019.05.037) and a [metabolomics dataset](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167309) from urinary samples analyzed by NMR spectroscop are used.

# Highlights

* Methodology for assessing the statistical significance of patterns in tensor data.

* Mitigation of false positive discoveries by reducing spurious patterns.

* Handling of temporal dependencies and misalignments in three-way time series data.

* Sensitivity to three-way data with non-identically distributed variables.

* Corrections for multiple hypotheses under Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
